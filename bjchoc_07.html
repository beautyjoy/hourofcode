    <h3>Step 8: Remember and display the Maximum score</h3>
    <p><strong>Keep track of the high score within each game</strong>.  </p>
    <p>Make a new variable <code>MAX SCORE</code> that appears on the stage (you can move it  so it doesn't hide <code>SCORE</code>), and have it always contain the highest score ever achieved in that one game.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As in step 7, you will  need to use <code>if</code> to decide when to change <code>SCORE</code>. </p>
