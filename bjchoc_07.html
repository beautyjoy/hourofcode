    <h3>Step 8: Remember and display the Maximum score</h3>
    <p>Using the same ideas as for the last step (doing things according to a certain case), <strong>keep track of the high score within each game</strong>.  Make a new variable <code>MAX SCORE</code> that appears on the stage (you can move it around so it doesn't hide <code>SCORE</code>), and have it always contain the highest score ever achieved in that one game.</p>
