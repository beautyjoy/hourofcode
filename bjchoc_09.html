    <h3>Step 10: Do anything you want ... be creative!</h3>
    <p>
        The <em>Beauty and Joy of Computing</em> is about being creative! Experiment with the <strong>Snap<em>!</em></strong> interface. Here are some ideas:
        <ul>
            <li>The "Pen" tab contains blocks that change the pen properties (color, size, shade, etc.). You could change it depending on certain things (like whether Alonzo is clicked, moves by itself, the high score is surpassed, etc.).</li>
            <li>The "Looks" tab contains blocks that control graphics of the sprite (Alonzo). You could change it (make it fade out, change its size, say something, etc.) depending on things that happen (like whether Alonzo is clicked, moves by itself, the high score is surpassed, etc.).</li>
            <li>Talk with your classmates. How else could you improve this game?</li>
        </ul>
