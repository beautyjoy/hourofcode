    <h3>Step 10: Invent new features for your game. Be creative!</h3>
    <p>
        Programming is a creative art. Experiment with  <strong>Snap<em>!</em></strong> Here are some ideas:
<ul>
            <li>The "Pen" tab contains blocks that change the pen properties (color, size, shade, etc.). You could change it all the time or only when certain things happen (like when Alonzo is clicked, moves by itself, the high score is surpassed, ...).</li>    <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <li>The "Looks" tab contains blocks that control how the sprite (Alonzo) looks. You could change it (make it fade out, change its size, say something, etc.) all the time or only when certain things happen.</li>    <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <li>Talk with others. How else could you improve this game?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
