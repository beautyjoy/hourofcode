    <h3>Step 9: Have Alonzo trace where he's been, clearing with high scores</h3>
    <p><strong>Keep track of Alonzo's path</strong> using the "pen" which can be in an "up" or "down" position. When the pen is down and Alonzo is moved from one place to another, Snap! will trace Alonzo's movement.</p>
    <p><strong>Clear all the pen traces when the user achieves a high score.</strong></p>
