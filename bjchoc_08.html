    <h3>Step 9: Have Alonzo trace where it has been and clear traces when the player sets a new high score</h3>
    <p><strong>Keep track of Alonzo's path</strong> using the "pen" which can be in an "up" or "down" position. </p>
    <p>When the pen is down and Alonzo moves from one place to another, Snap! will trace Alonzo's movement.</p>
	<p><strong>Clear all the pen traces when the user achieves a high score.</strong></p>
