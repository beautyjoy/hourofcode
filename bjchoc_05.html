    <h3>Step 6: Implement a <code>SCORE</code> that rises with clicks and falls with misses</h3>
    <p>
    	Make another variable called <code>SCORE</code> that:
    	<ul>
    		<li> starts at 0,</li>
            <li>goes up by 10 points every time Alonzo is clicked,</li>
            <li>and goes down by 1 every time it moves on its own because it wasn't clicked.</li>
        </ul>
