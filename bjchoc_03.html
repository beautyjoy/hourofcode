	<!-- <p>When a script (maybe the one starting with <code>When I am clicked</code> hat block) is running and that hat block is triggered again while the first time is still running, the first one stops and is forgotten. So, if the script were going to say "Snap<em>!</em>" slowly, and it got interrupted twice, it might say "Sn-Sn-Snap!". </p> <div class="comment">This is unnecessary. If a person does click twice, they'll discover it, and it's not needed or useful here.</div> -->
