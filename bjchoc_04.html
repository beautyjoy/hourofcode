<H2>Step 5: Make Alonzo move more often when he's not clicked</H2>
<p>
The idea for this step is to have the delay between when the unclicked
sprite moves to a different position get smaller every time.  The delay
will start at 2 and drop by 0.1 second every time it's not clicked.
</p>
<p>
You should make a new variable called <tt>DELAY</tt> (to keep consistent with 
our solution).
