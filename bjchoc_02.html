    <h3>Step 3: Welcome the visitor by having Alonzo say a message</h3>
    <!--<p>Up until now, you've been the player of the game, so you've known what to do. It would be good to tell the user how to play the game.</p>-->
    <p>Have Alonzo <strong>move to (190, -130) and say a welcome message whenever the green flag <img src="file:///Macintosh HD/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/hourofcode/Flag-and-stop-sign.png" alt="green flag and stop sign" /> is clicked</strong> (at the top right). </p>
    <p>The message should also <strong>tell the user to click on Alonzo</strong> and then <strong> disappear when the user clicks.</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the <code>Say</code> block with a blank input will get Alonzo to say nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking the green flag is one way to start a Snap! program. You can stop the program by clicking the red stop sign. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Snap<em>!</em>, two scripts can run simultaneously. You now have one script that runs when you click on Alonzo, and one that runs when you click on the green flag. </p>
