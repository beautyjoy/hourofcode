    <h3>Step 3: Welcome the visitor by having Alonzo say a message</h3>
    <!--<p>Up until now, you've been the player of the game, so you've known what to do. It would be good to tell the user how to play the game.</p>-->
    <p>Have Alonzo <strong>move to (190, -130) and say a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked</strong> (at the top right). (This is the normal way Snap<em>!</em> projects begin; they stop by clicking the red stop sign.) <strong>Tell the user to click on Alonzo, and have the message disappear and once they do so.</strong> (This step is a little tricky; note that if Alonzo uses the <code>Say</code> block with a blank input, he'll stop saying things.)</p>
    <p>You can have two "scripts" of code, each started with a "hat block" that tells the script to run. In Snap<em>!</em>, two scripts can run simultaneously.</p>
