    <h3>Step 2: Make Alonzo move to a random spot when clicked</h3>
    <p>Now, <strong>add blocks so that every time Alonzo is clicked it moves to a random position</strong> (between -190 and 190 in the <em>x</em> direction and between -130 and 130 in the <em>y</em> direction).</p>
    <p>Oval-shaped blocks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random () to ()" title="pick random () to ()" /> can <em>report</em> their values as inputs to other blocks. To use an oval-shaped block that way, drag it into the blank input slot in another block.</p>

    <p>One good way to find out what a block does is to click on it and try it out. </p>
    <p>Also remember that you can right-click on it (control-click on a Mac) and choose "help..."</p>
