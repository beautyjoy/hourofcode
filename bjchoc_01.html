<h3>Step 2: Make Alonzo move to a random spot when clicked</h3>
<p>
This task involves adding blocks to your step 1 solution so that, every time Alonzo is clicked, he moves to a random position (between -190 and 190 in the <tt>x</tt> direction, and between -130 and 130 in the <tt>y</tt> direction).

You can have two "clusters" of code, each headed by a "hat block" that starts that cluster running.  The great thing about <b><i>Snap!</i></b> is that two clusters can run simultaneously. Also, remember, to find out what a block does, right-click on it (control-click on a Mac) and choose <tt>"help..."</tt>
