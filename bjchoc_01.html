    <h3>Step 2: Make Alonzo move to a random spot when clicked</h3>
    <p>Now, <strong>add blocks so that, every time Alonzo is clicked, he moves to a random position</strong> (between -190 and 190 in the <em>x</em> direction and between -130 and 130 in the <em>y</em> direction).</p>
    <p>Blocks shaped like <em>ovals</em> are used to <em>return</em> values (they don't "do" anything). They are meant to be dragged into oval-shaped blanks, which will turn white to indicate that you can drop them in.</p>
    <p>(Recall, to find out what a block does, you can right-click on it (control-click on a Mac) and choose "help...")</p>
