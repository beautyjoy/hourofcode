    <h3>Step 1: Make your first Mobile App with only 2 blocks!</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the <em>Beauty and Joy of Computing</em> Hour of Code. You'll be using Snap<em>!</em>, a graphical programming language, to make a mobile app game.<div class="comment">Do we need this?</div></p> 
    <p>Program the yellow Alonzo sprite to <strong>turn around when it is clicked</strong>. To do that, drag the two blocks from the palette (to the right of this text) to the scripting area (to the right of the palette) and snap them together to form a script. Scripts run the blocks from top to bottom.  </p>
    <p>If it works properly, you should be able to click <em>on Alonzo</em> and it will face the other way.</p>
  <p>(Clicking on a script also runs the script.)</p>
    <p>Once you think you're done, go to the next step by clicking  <img src="file:///Macintosh HD/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/hourofcode/green-NEXT-button.png" alt="green NEXT button" />. If you get stuck, you can  click "show me the answer" to see our version (and then fix your version), or click "replace my code" and we'll replace your solution with ours.</p>
