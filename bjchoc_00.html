    <h3>Step 1: Start your first Mobile App with only 2 blocks!</h3>
    <!-- <p>Welcome to the <em>Beauty and Joy of Computing</em> Hour of Code. You'll be using Snap<em>!</em>, a graphical programming language, to make a mobile app game.<div class="comment">Do we need this?</div></p> -->
  <p>Program the yellow Alonzo sprite to <strong>turn around when it is clicked</strong>. </p>
    <p>To do that, drag the two blocks into the gray scripting area and snap them together to form a script. </p>
  <p>If your script works, then, when you click <em><strong>on Alonzo</strong></em> he should  face the other way.</p>
  
    <p>Once you think you're done, go to the next step by clicking  <img src="file:///Macintosh HD/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/hourofcode/green-NEXT-button.png" alt="green NEXT button" />. </p>

  <p>If you want help, you can  click "show me the answer" to see our version (and then fix yours), or you can click "replace my code" and we'll replace your solution with ours.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you want to find out what a block does, you can right-click it (or control-click on a Mac) and choose "help..."</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Scripts run their blocks from top to bottom. Clicking on any script  runs the script, but you want <em>this</em> script to run when you click <em>on Alonzo.</em></p>
